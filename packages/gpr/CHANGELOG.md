# @packlet/gpr

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 54ea4c5: Improves version control and stability by ensuring each package depends on a fixed, published version of its dependencies.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 65523e5: - Added support for a `packlet.gprName` field in `package.json` for each package, allowing explicit override of the GPR package name (scoped or unscoped). If unscoped, the chosen scope is applied automatically.
  - In monorepos, the default base name for GPR is now always the package's own name (scope stripped), not the repo name, to avoid registry conflicts. Single-package repos may use the repo name if it differs from the package name.
  - Internal dependencies in monorepos retain their original npm package names when preparing for GPR; only version ranges are normalized (e.g., workspace protocol to semver).
  - Improved validation for `gprName` overrides, accepting only valid scoped or unscoped names and warning on invalid values.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 1099c2b: Update the CLI entrypoints in both `packages/cli/src/index.ts` and `packages/gpr/src/index.ts` to improve compatibility with both CommonJS (CJS) and ECMAScript Module (ESM) environments. The main change is a refactor of the logic that determines whether the CLI should be executed when the script is run directly, ensuring correct behavior regardless of module type.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 5f83f4d: This update modernizes the build system by making ESM the default output format (CJS now opt-in), disabling sourcemaps by default, and adding external dependency handling. The changes reduce package sizes and improve flexibility for library consumers.
  - ESM-first approach: All packages now default to ESM output with CJS available via `--cjs` flag
  - Sourcemap optimization: Disabled by default; inline maps coerced to external to prevent large base64 embeds
  - External dependencies: New `--external` and `--external-auto` flags to avoid bundling dependencies

- Updated dependencies [5f83f4d]
  - @packlet/core@0.1.1
